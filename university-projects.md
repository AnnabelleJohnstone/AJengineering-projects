# University Projects


Here are some of the key engineering projects I worked on during my university studies:

##  Featured Projects

### [FPGA Snake Game](/_projects/fpga-snake-game.md) 
A complete hardware implementation of the classic Snake game on Basys 3 FPGA with VGA output and real-time graphics. Features modular Verilog design, LFSR random generation, and hierarchical state machines.
