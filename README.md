# Annabelle Johnstone — Engineering Projects

Welcome to my personal engineering project showcase! This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as part of my journey in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering at The University of Edinburgh.

## Visit My Website

[AJengineering-projects GitHub Pages](https://annabellejohnstone.github.io/AJengineering-projects/)

## What You'll Find

- **About Me:** A short introduction and a separate page with more about my interests, university life, and extracurricular activities.
- **University Projects:** A space for academic engineering projects (coming soon).
- **At Home Projects:** Personal projects and creative work outside university (coming soon).

## How It's Built

- **Jekyll**: Static site generator that turns simple Markdown files into a website.
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting for static sites, tightly integrated with GitHub repositories.
- **Custom Styling**: See `styles.css` for the look and feel.
