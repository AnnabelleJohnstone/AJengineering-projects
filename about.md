# About Me

Hi, I’m Annabelle, a Mechanical and Electrical engineering student at The University of Edinburgh.

Beyond my studies, I run my own small business where I design and sew my own clothes, combining creativity with technical skill. I’m an active member of the university community: I participate in the **Powerlifting Society** and the **Open Water Swimming Society**, always seeking new challenges and ways to stay active.

I’m proud to serve as the **Social Secretary** for the Mechanical Engineering Society, where I organize events and foster a welcoming environment for all members. I am also a passionate advocate for **women in STEM**, working to create opportunities and support networks for underrepresented groups in engineering and technology.

My technical skills include:
- Programming (Python, MATLAB, C++)
- CAD design (SolidWorks)
- Robotics and automation

## Interests
- Robotics  
- Renewable energy  
- Creative electronics  

## Extracurriculars
