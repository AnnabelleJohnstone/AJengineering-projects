# About Me

Hi, I’m Annabelle, a Mechanical and Electrical engineering student at The University of Edinburgh.

Beyond my studies, I run my own small business where I design and sew my own clothes, combining creativity with technical skill. I’m an active member of the university community: I participate in the Powerlifting Society and the Open Water Swimming Society, always seeking new challenges and ways to stay active.

I’m proud to serve as the Social Secretary for the Mechanical Engineering Society, where I organize events and foster a welcoming environment for all members. I am also a passionate advocate for women in STEM, working to create opportunities and support networks for underrepresented groups in engineering and technology.

My technical skills include programming (Python, MATLAB, C++), CAD design (SolidWorks), and hands-on experience in robotics and automation.
